COCO is a set of customizations to Chocolatey.
For suggestions, you can reach me @zarcolio on Twitter or GitHub.

Usage:

 COCO backup [batch]            Creates a backup of installed packages to text (default) or batch file.
 COCO cleanup                   Cleans the Chocolatey environment from temp and other useless files.
 COCO installed [<package>]     Lists which packages have been installed.
 COCO reinstall <package> [-y]  Reinstall this package by uninstalling and installing this package.
 COCO restore <file>            Restore a backup from file.
 COCO setup                     Sets up Coco (installs choco-cleaner and Coco itself).
 COCO update [-y]               updates all packages but only shows updated packages.
